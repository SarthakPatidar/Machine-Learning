## K-Nearest Neighbors
### Objectives
* Classify the data point into particular group based on value of K.

### Best Practices
* Pick a value of K to be an odd number greater than number of groups.

### Terminologies 
* Confidence : Determined by how well does the classifier assigns a group to a particular data point. 
* Accuracy : Determined by how well the classifier performs on the testing dataset.
* Euclidean Distance : The distance between the data points calculated by the formula :  <br/><br/> <img src="https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/795b967db2917cdde7c2da2d1ee327eb673276c0" alt="euclidean_distance">
