## Linear Regression with two variables
### Steps Followed
1. Data Setup : Build pair of points (x,y) to fit the line.
2. Assume m as slope and b as the y-intercept of the best fit line.
3. Calculate the value of m and b using the equations below.
* Slope of line <br /> ![slope formula](https://github.com/SarthakPatidar/Machine-Learning/blob/master/Supervised%20Learning/algorithms/linear%20regression/resources/slope.png)

* Y-Intercept of line <br /> ![y_intercept formula](https://github.com/SarthakPatidar/Machine-Learning/blob/master/Supervised%20Learning/algorithms/linear%20regression/resources/y_intercept.png)

4. Plot the (x,y) pairs along with the best fit regression line.
